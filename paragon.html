                        B.I. stands for “business
                        intelligence,” an industry term 
                        which isn't particularly helpful in 
                        explaining much about what it 
                        actually does. B.I. tools allow you 
                        to manipulate data in order to 
                        combine and extract the specific 
                        information that is most relevant 
                        to answering your burning 
                        business questions. Basically, B.I. 
                        should help you make evidence-
                        based decisions and enable you 
                        to prepare for world domination.

                    <h2>What Is Paragon</h2>
                    <p>
                    After more than 25 years in the ERP business, we decided it was time for change. So, we went
                    back to the drawing board to create an ERP system from scratch. Our goal: to create an ERP system 
                    that's better in every respect - from its look and feel, to its usability and functionality. From there, 
                    Paragon was born. Don't be fooled by its pretty looks, Paragon is an incredibly powerful and user-
                    friendly system that does everything you need it to do.

                    </p>
                    <hr class="featurette-divider">
                    <h2>What makes Paragon different from the other guys?</h2>
                    <p>
                    For some reason, ERP software hasn't evolved at the same speed as most modern consumer
                    software. Modern consumer software is cool, intuitive and user-friendly, while traditional ERP software 
                    is cluttered, complicated and confusing. And there are millions of people who use this outdated, 
                    irritating and infuriating software every single day. But just because something is powerful, doesn't 
                    mean it has to be complicated. 
                    <br><br>
                    In general, people <u>hate</u> ERP systems. We decided to figure out why. From there, we designed something 
                    that would address those reasons. 
                    Here are our <u><b>Top 6 Reasons ERP Systems Have Sucked</b></u> (Historically Speaking):
                    </p>
                    <h3>Reason #1 - ERP systems aren't easy to use and need lots of training to master.</h3>
                    <p><u>Paragon is easy to use.</u></p>
                    <p><i>Paragon is designed to look like what it does.</i></p>
                    <p>
                    For example, the purchase order looks like an actual purchase order, notes are taken on a notepad, and 
                    the digital accounting journal looks like its real life counterpart. With digital elements that resemble real 
                    world objects, Paragon appeals to the user's intuition making it easier to use without much training.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>Paragon looks like modern consumer software user interfaces.</i></p>
                    <p>Although the enterprise application market is larger than most other software markets, enterprise
                    applications lag when it comes to user interface. iPhone applications are modernized and updated 
                    constantly. Web applications, too. But for some reason, ERP systems haven't evolved the way other 
                    consumer software has. And we don't understand why. When we think about it... people are using an 
                    ERP solution for the majority of their day, and we felt that they shouldn't have to work with software 
                    that looks like it still lives in the 1990s.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Reason #2 - ERP systems don't do what you want them to do.</h3>
                    <p><u>Paragon actually does what you want it to.</u></p>
                    <p>You know how, when dealing with your customers or vendors, each one of them has to be a special
                    snowflake... as in, no two are the same? Well, we developed this thing we call the “rules engine.” It 
                    allows us to set conditions for your system, or even to customize the code to suit processes that relate 
                    uniquely to your business. Want to ship additional goods only when the moon is full and the shipper is 
                    wearing a blue sweater and doing the Macarena? Done. The rules engine would allow for these changes 
                    to be created quickly and efficiently.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Reason #3 - ERP systems don't always run smoothly.</h3>
                    <p><u>Paragon does. It's just that simple.</u></p>
                    <p><i>Design Process</i></p>
                    <p>
                    To ensure quality and reliability, Paragon was designed using the agile method of software 
                    development, which is an iterative and incremental development process. This process is divided 
                    into short and regular “sprints” of work, with the goal of producing a completely functional product 
                    increment by the end of each sprint. This allows for every aspect of the design process to be reviewed 
                    and revised at short intervals. Thus, the direction of the project can continually be adjusted and 
                    evaluated.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Cloud</u></p>
                    <p>
                    Paragon sits on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, which offers a number of advantages for its
                    functionality. Cloud applications can perform at any required speed, on-demand. Data is encrypted and 
                    secured from viruses. And finally, data can also be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, 
                    at any time. For more information on the cloud, click here.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Scalability</u></p>
                    <p>
                    Paragon is completely scalable and can grow to accommodate all database and user needs. Paragon's
                    concurrent licensing model allows an unlimited number of users, and user licences can be purchased 
                    quickly and easily online. Furthermore, since Paragon sits on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, it has 
                    unlimited storage, so it can scale up (or down) on demand, automatically, to meet the needs of our 
                    customers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Reason #4 - ERP systems have limited feature sets.</h3>
                    <p><u>Paragon has a HUGE feature set.</u></p>
                    <p>
                    Most ERP systems claim they come with all the modules you'll possibly need. They lie. And most of the
                    time, the company either doesn't even have specific modules, or does, but did not include it in your 
                    contract, meaning you'll have to pay more. Our customer service representatives were drowning in calls 
                    requesting additional modules. We saw the problem so we addressed it. Paragon is a comprehensive 
                    and all-inclusive software that really truly has all the features you need. <i>Honestly</i>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Reason #5 - ERP systems always cost more than expected.</h3>
                    <p><u>Paragon does not defy cost expectations. Our pricing model is simple.</u></p>
                    <p>
                    You have two choices. That's it, that’s all. Check out our pricing page for more info.
                    <ul>
                        <li>$150/user/month for our basic package</li>
                        <li>$300/user/month for our complete package</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><i>Don't look for the fine print. There are no hidden costs here.</i></p>
                    <p>
                    Typically, what you think you'll be paying for an ERP system is not what you actually pay. There are
                    a number of hidden costs. Aside from purchasing the software licenses, you may also pay for new 
                    hardware (such as server and computers), maintenance fees associated with the upkeep of the 
                    hardware, service charges, and customization fees. Paragon operates on the cloud, so there is no need 
                    to purchase hardware. That means you can use the computer you already have and you don't need a 
                    new server either. Plus, we're responsible for IT so that’s another thing you’re not worrying about.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>Paragon doesn't lock you into a long contract.</i></p>
                    <p>Our pricing model means that you pay either $150 or $300 per user per month, so you can terminate
                    your contract whenever you like.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Reason #6 - ERP systems require you to pay for demos and trials.</h3>

					<h2>FAQ</h2>
                    <h4>What happens if the server goes down?</h4>
                    <p><b>Outlook good.</b>Paragon sits on the Microsoft Azure platform. Paragon uses a Level 1 server which is
                    underground and secure. In the highly unlikely event that Microsoft's server goes down, your server 
                    problems won't be your primary concern. In any case, if the server were to go down in the absence of 
                    natural disasters and life threatening events, we will get you back up and running within the day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    On the bright side, if the Microsoft servers do go down, everyone goes down. At least we have that
                    going for us, right?
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>...Right?</p>
                    <h4>Won't paying per user per month end up being more expensive than a normal application?</h4>
                    <p><b>Very doubtful.</b> 
                    It depends on the pricing model, but Paragon is intended to be more cost effective
                    than traditional ERP applications. By traditional ERP applications, we're talking about the whole kit and 
                    caboodle: new software, new hardware, licenses, maintenance, training, customizations, and so on. 
                    Software as a service (SaaS) on the other hand, is designed to be cheaper over time because it reduces 
                    the cost associated with hardware, downtimes, and updates over the long term.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Does Paragon work faster in different browsers?</h4>
                    <p><b>My reply is no.</b> 
                    The browser you use has no effect on Paragon's performance. Paragon's platform 
                    independence allows for it to operate just as fast in any browser.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Does Paragon slow down significantly when dealing with bulk operations (e.g. processing
                    orders with many line items)?</h4>
                    <p><b>My sources say no.</b> 
                    (Don't count on it.) We've noticed that many cloud applications slow down
                    dramatically while processing bulk operations. Paragon is different. Paragon takes an approach that 
                    allows mass operations to be carried out comparatively quickly. We even tested it. We loaded over 
                    6,000 order lines into a new order in under 3 seconds. Click here for the test results.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Is Paragon updated periodically?</h4>
                    <p><b>As I see it, yes</b>
                    We understand that users don't like change once they're familiar with an application.
                    All of our updates are specifically designed to enhance Paragon without changing it. We don't make 
                    changes for the sake of making changes. We do it for a purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Once an update has been decided upon, we go through an internal process to test its functionality.
                    A test group of users then tests the update again before we push the update out across the whole 
                    infrastructure. Users will be notified when updates are made. And for added security, we maintain a 
                    rollback functionality which means that we can undo the update if anything goes wrong.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Can two people edit the same data at the same time?</h4>
                    <p><b>Yes.</b>
                    And it won't cause mass destruction of your data. The second user will be notified that changes
                    were made while they were editing and will be asked if they would like to proceed. Paragon will issue a 
                    warning before they proceed to edit the data.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Does Paragon use partners/third parties for implementation?</h4>
                    <p><b>You may rely on it.</b>
                    Jonar only agrees to partner with awesome third-party channel partners. They have
                    to be certified and authorized to sell our services, implement systems, and train you guys without any 
                    problems. Our partners have the team and services available to ensure a smooth transition. We are 
                    always looking to increase our network of implementation agents, whose role will be to guide and assist 
                    with this.

                    <h4>We have limited IT resources. Will we need to hire a full time IT person?</h4>
                    <p><b>All signs point to no.</b>
                    Paragon is platform and database independent, and does not require a server.
                    As long as you have a stable internet connection, you will not have any problems. The administration 
                    interface is easy enough for anyone to use. Backups, performance, and redundancy are all managed by 
                    us. So, no worries, we got you.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Is Paragon scalable? Can we add new users at a later date?</h4>
                    <p><b> Yes, definitely</b>
                    Paragon has a concurrent licensing model which means you can have as many users as
                    you would like. Your Paragon Administrator can create new users. The number of users who can access 
                    the system at any one time however will depend on the number of licenses you have purchased. You 
                    can purchase additional user licenses HERE.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Can Paragon handle lots of data?</h4>
                    <p><b>Without a doubt</b>
                    The Paragon cloud sits on the Microsoft Azure platform, a cloud platform that ensures
                    unlimited storage. This means it scales up (or down) on demand, automatically, to meet your needs.

                    <h4>Is web-based ERP more ideal than server-based solution?</h4>
                    <p><b>All signs point to yes</b>
                    There are a number of reasons web-based ERP is favourable: for one, the cost.
                    Traditionally, in addition to purchasing the software licence, companies pay for the hardware (servers, 
                    etc.), implementation, and the ongoing IT costs associated with maintenance. Implementation of web-
                    based ERP is faster and cheaper than traditional ERP, and since we house the hardware, web based ERP 
                    eliminates the costs associated with hardware and maintenance. Over the long term, web-based ERP is 
                    more cost effective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Additionally, web-based ERP can perform at speeds as fast as you may need it, and it does so on-
                    demand. Data managed through web-based ERP is secure. Your data is encrypted and isolated from the 
                    network, so no viruses can corrupt your data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Finally, web-based ERP is scalable. The system can grow infinitely to accommodate any of your database
                    and user's needs. Web-based ERP is also flexible, allowing users to access data anywhere, and at any 
                    time. With a web-based ERP system, there is little risk and commitment involved. You can change your 
                    mind at any moment and opt out of the ERP services easily.

                    <h4>Can I purchase individual modules?</h4>
                    <p><b>Absolutely,</b>
                    go for it! And when you purchase one, we'll throw in all the rest of them for free!
                    </p>

                    <h4>Can I try Paragon for free, without any risk of being charged?</h4>
                    <p><b>Yes.</b>In fact, we offer a 30-day trial which you can sign up for here.</p>

                    <h4>Can I control what data each of my users have access to?</h4>
                    <p><b>As I see it, yes.</b> 
                    We have very granular user group and division access controls. User profiles are also
                    role-based, allowing you to further control which data is accessible by certain users.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Will the application be slow if many people are accessing the system at the same time?</h4>
                    <p><b>My reply is no.</b>
                    Well, theoretically it will slow down, but Microsoft Azure allows Paragon to use

                    scalable architecture that can expand by a factor of 32 times in the span of 90 seconds, automatically. 

                    Essentially, the expansion is fast enough you won't even notice the difference.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Do I need permanent internet connection to work with Paragon?</h4>
                    <p><b>It is decidedly no.</b>
                    Paragon requires an internet connection. If you can't access the cloud then you

                    can't access the software. There are a number of ways to ensure permanent connectivity, including 

                    redundant networks and cellular connection.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Am I in charge of backing up my own data?</h4>
                    <p><b>Very doubtful.</b>
                    If your data is hosted on the cloud, we are responsible.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Can I get copies of my data once it has been backed up?</h4>
                    <b>Without a doubt</b>

                    <h4>Will Paragon work on devices other than my desktop computer?</h4>
                    <p><b>Signs point to yes.</b>
                    Paragon works on any device that runs Java, including all devices that have a Mac

                    OS, Windows OS, or Linux OS. Paragon also works on all browsers that can run Java, including mobile 

                    devices. For a more comprehensive list of devices that run Java, click here.
                    </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, at this moment, we can't guarantee it'll work on your toaster oven or other kitchen

                    devices. Perhaps in due time...

                    <h4>If my competitors use the same system, will they be able to see or hack into my company's
                        data?</h4>
                    <p><b>My reply is no</b>
                    Paragon uses an isolated tenant model, which means that there is root level segregation

                    of the data by tenant. Not even Jonar can go from one tenant's data to another. There is no cross tenant 
                    data sharing. The tenant is hard coded to make the system fetch the information only related to it.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Can Paragon be accessed from anywhere in the world?</h4>
                    <p><b>As I see it, yes.</b>
                    Paragon is accessible anywhere with an active internet connection. So, if there's a way to
                    access the web, you could even log in from the bottom of a mineshaft or at the top of Mount Everest.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Does Paragon work on the major databases?</h4>
                    <p><b>It is decidedly so.</b>
                    Paragon is database-independent, so it works on databases such as but not limited to
                    MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>What is platform-independence?</h4>
                    <p>
                    Platform-independence don't need no man. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It's basically when you create an application that can be run on most types on software platforms (like 

                    MacOS, Linux, Unix, Windows), or on any hardware platform (PC, Mac, SunSparc, etc.). Most programs 

                    written in Java love this stuff.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What is database-independence?</h4>
                    <p>Database-independence involves storing generated data in a location separate from the application that 
                    uses it. The data is then kept safely away from the application and is archived accordingly.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What is the Cloud?</h4>
                    <p>When referring to "The Cloud" in the technology industry, we are transcending its traditional meaning
                    of being a floating mass of condensed water vapour which hangs out in the atmosphere. The cloud in 
                    tech speak refers to storing and accessing your applications on the Internet instead of your computer's 
                    network.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What is SaaS (Software as a Service)?</h4>
                    <p>
                    SaaS is the prefix of the exaggerated pronunciation of "Saassssy". 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    No. In all seriousness, Software as a Service involves selling a software with a services model, which is to 

                    say that there is no need for installing software on your local computer. You are paying for the service of 

                    using the software instead of owning a part of it.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Who owns my data?</h4>

                    <h4>Isn't operating within the cloud risky?</h4>
                    <p><b>My sources say no.</b>
                   Accessing Paragon through the web actually offers protection against viruses as well 
                    as reduces your exposure to data breaches.
